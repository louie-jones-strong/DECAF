#questions
- do i need to be able to prove that it has an impact or can it just be theretical
- how much time do i have
- how much time do i need
- how much is it based on code?
- how much maths
- can others help
- what format does it need to be presented in
- what would be best format / outcome for portfolio


# goals
needs to be visual
interactive?
think about the deadline
break the problem down it doesn't all need to be ML there can / should be parts that use known algorithons


# problem selection
before tring to fix a issue time should be spend to find out what problem should be solved
start by breaking the large feild down into a number of smaller feilds that and do pros and cons on each of those feilds

##AGI
### what does my paper need to show to be able to prove step in AGI
diffrent input methods
diffrent output methods
how do humans learn

### solutions
#### meta network that picks a path through other sub networks
#### can the ai explain the problem back to you before starting to fix it
#### interface with already known networks (kaggle, gpt3, image net)
#### each sub network explains the data format it expects and sends
#### this will help the path network
#### look at https://www.wolframalpha.com/
