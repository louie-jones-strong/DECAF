# Questions
- do i need to be able to prove that it has an impact or can it just be theoretical
- how much time do i have
- how much time do i need
- how much is it based on code?
- how much maths
- can others help
- what format does it need to be presented in
- what would be best format / outcome for portfolio


# Goals
needs to be visual
interactive?
think about the deadline
break the problem down it doesn't all need to be ML there can / should be parts that use known algorithms


# problem selection
before tring to fix a issue time should be spend to find out what problem should be solved
start by breaking the large field down into a number of smaller field that and do pros and cons on each of those field

## AGI
### what does my paper need to show to be able to prove step in AGI
different input methods
different output methods
how do humans learn

### solutions
#### define what is general intelligence
#### meta network that picks a path through other sub networks
#### can the ai explain the problem back to you before starting to fix it
#### interface with already known networks (kaggle, gpt3, image net)
#### each sub network explains the data format it expects and sends
#### this will help the path network
#### look at https://www.wolframalpha.com/
#### user explain the problem open ai then creates the env to test and train in, then learns from that
#### better skill compression large network to smaller or spot pattens between networks
##### meta network , training tries many meta networks with some nodes locked, aka image net, then picks the best preforming one

## simulation

## art creation

## make it easier for the games industry to use ML
## fast and cheap to re learn



# how to present findings
